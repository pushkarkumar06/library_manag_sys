# Library Management System 
# Project overview

This is a Library Management System built in C++. It allows users to manage books in a library, borrow or return books, and track the status of each book. The system differentiates between two types of users: Students and Faculty, each having their own borrowing limits. The program handles basic library operations like adding books, adding users, borrowing books, and returning books.





## Acknowledgements

The project was inspired by the need to automate and manage a library system efficiently.
Thanks to the open-source community for their constant contributions to programming libraries and resources.


## Usage/Examples

After compiling and running the program, you will interact with the system through a simple text-based menu. Below are the options available to the user:

-> Add Book: Add a new book to the library by entering the book's ID, title, and author.
-> Add User: Add a new user to the system by specifying the user's ID, name, and type (Student or Faculty).
-> Display Books: Display all the books in the library with their availability status.
-> Borrow Book: A user can borrow a book by providing their user ID and the book's ID. Each user has a borrowing limit (3 for Students and 5 for Faculty).
-> Return Book: A user can return a borrowed book by providing the book's ID.
-> Exit: Exit the program.
